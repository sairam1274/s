    <h3>PSUs Recruitment through GATE</h3>
      <p>Public sector undertakings (PSUs) in India, for long, have had troubles conducting their recruitment processes with more than 1Lakh students giving the exams for less than 1000 jobs (a selection rate of less than 1%). After sensing the exponential rise in the number of engineering graduates in India who wish to get a PSU job, the PSUs have decided that a <b>GATE score shall be the primary criteria for initial short listing</b>. This change was the primary cause for the rapid increase in applicants for GATE 2012.</p>
      
      <p><b>Indian Oil Corporation </b>was the first PSU which successfully tested out this system and was followed two years later by <b>National Thermal Power Corporation</b>, <b>Bharat Heavy Electricals</b>,<b> Bharat Electronics </b>&<b> PowerGrid Corporation of India</b>.</p>

      <p>Usually these companies release their recruitment notifications right after GATE notification, indicating that candidates have to take GATE to be considered for a job in their organizations.</p>

    <h3>Latest list of PSU companies (GATE 2014):</h3>
      <p>As of now, the following public sector undertakings have signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with the GATE 2014 organizing committee, for using GATE 2014 score as a screening tool for recruiting engineers at entry level positions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="lis"><b>Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd.</b></li>
      <li class="lis"><b>Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd.</b></li>
      <li class="lis"><b>Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.</b></li>
      <li class="lis"><b>National Fertilizers Ltd.</b></li>
      <li class="lis"><b>Neyveli Lignite Corporation Ltd.</b></li>
      <li class="lis"><b>National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Ltd.</b></li>
      <li class="lis"><b>National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd.</b></li>
      <li class="lis"><b>Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.
      <li class="lis"><b>Vizag Steel Plant
      <li class="lis"><b>Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL)
      <li class="lis"><b>Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd.</b></li>
      <li class="lis"><b>Mazagon Dock Ltd.</b></li>
      <li class="lis"><b>National Aluminium Company Ltd.</b></li>
      <li class="lis"><b>Rail India Technical and Economic Services Ltd.</b></li>
    </ul>

     <p>Many other PSUs are also processing the MoU and these are in progress.</p>

    <h3>Salary offered by PSUs</h3>
      <p>Public Sector companies are competing the corporate companies in salary packages. In fact some companies are paying better than the top software and IT companies even in the early stages of their career. An engineering graduate or management trainee can draw up to 7 to 8 lakhs as a starting salary package in reputed Public Sector Units. Candidates have to undergo training for a specific probationary period and after successful completion of training they will be absorbed as permanent employees with tedious salary.</p>  

    <p>After PSUs started their recruitments through <b>Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering </b>the competition for <b>GATE </b>is also increased tremendously. So if a candidate could score the required cut-off score for IIT or M.Tech. seat he will be able to succeed for the PSUs. </p>
